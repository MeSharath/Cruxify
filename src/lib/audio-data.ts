// This file acts as a mock database for pre-generated audio files.
// In a real application, this data might be stored in a proper database or a file storage service.
// The audio data is a Base64-encoded string representing the audio file.
// IMPORTANT: The current data is a tiny, silent MP3 placeholder. It is not real audio.
// To get real audio, you would need to:
// 1. Generate an MP3 file from the summary text using a service like ElevenLabs.
// 2. Convert that MP3 file to a Base64 string.
// 3. Replace the placeholder string below with the real Base64 string.
// 4. Wrap it in 'data:audio/mpeg;base64,...'
